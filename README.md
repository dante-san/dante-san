# Laxmidhar Maharana
**Senior Backend Engineer | System Architect**

I specialize in architecting distributed systems and high-concurrency APIs, with a focus on the Laravel and MySQL ecosystem. My approach centers on building resilient, multi-tenant architectures that prioritize data integrity and long-term maintainability.

### Engineering Philosophy
I believe in "boring" technology implemented brilliantly. Over the past 7 years, I have transitioned from building features to designing systems that scale. This includes optimizing legacy bottlenecks—reducing 30s response times to 3s—and leading engineering teams through complex full-lifecycle transitions.

### Core Competencies
* [cite_start]**Architectural Design:** Multi-Tenancy (row-level isolation), Repository & Service patterns, and ACID-compliant transaction management[cite: 11, 20, 21].
* [cite_start]**System Optimization:** Performance tuning via Laravel Queues, Redis caching, and advanced query optimization (eliminating N+1 overhead)[cite: 9, 18, 22].
* [cite_start]**Integrations:** Designing robust payment workflows (Razorpay, PhonePe, CCAvenue) and fleet tracking systems with external GIS services[cite: 20, 25, 26].
* [cite_start]**Leadership:** Mentoring junior developers and establishing Git-based review workflows that improve code quality by ~40%[cite: 16, 22, 23].

### Technical Environment
* [cite_start]**Backend:** PHP 8.x (Laravel, Livewire), CodeIgniter[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Data Persistence:** MySQL (Indexing, Selective Column Fetching), Redis[cite: 9, 19].
* [cite_start]**DevOps & Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS S3, and automated queue processing[cite: 11, 15, 18].
